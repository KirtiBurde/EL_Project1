1. 🌎 Map: CO₂ Level by Country

Color-coded Map:

Red: High emission countries

Orange: Medium emission countries

Blue-Green: Low emission countries


Insight:

Asia (China, India) and parts of Europe show high CO₂ levels.

North and South America show a mix of medium and low emissions.

Africa and Oceania mostly appear in the low category.


This helps identify geographical emission hotspots.

2. 📊 Total CO₂ Emission KPIs (Top 3 Cards)

Metric	Value	Explanation

Total CO₂ Emission	- 163K	- The global total emission in thousands of metric tons.
Avg. CO₂ per Capita -	1.78	- Average amount of CO₂ emitted per person.
Top 5 CO₂ % 	-  65.83%	Share of global emissions from the top 5 emitting countries.


Insight: A small group of countries contributes over 65% of emissions. Reducing their emissions can have a big global impact.

3. 🔥 Bar Chart: Total CO₂ Emission by Sector

Energy: 117K

Transport Sector: 28K

Industry: 18K


Insight:

The Energy sector is the largest emitter, contributing more than 70% of total CO₂.

Prioritizing clean energy alternatives (solar, wind, etc.) would significantly reduce emissions.

4. 🌐 Top 5 CO₂ Producing Countries

Country	Emissions (K)	% of Global Total

China -	71K	( 100% (base))
USA	- 27K (~38%)
India	14K	(20%)
Russia	11K	(~15%)
Brazil	6K	(~9%)


Insight:

China alone is responsible for over 43% of total emissions in this dataset.

USA and India follow, showing the importance of policy change in these nations.

5. 📈 Line Chart: Average CO₂ Emission by Country and Year (2020–2024)

China, USA, and India show the highest average yearly emissions.

Other countries like Russia, Japan, and Brazil show moderate but declining or stable trends.

Smaller countries have minimal contributions.


Insight:

This trend visualization highlights whether countries are improving or worsening in emissions over time.

It could reflect climate policies, industrial growth, or energy source changes.

✅ Overall Insights Summary:

1. 🌍 Global emissions are highly concentrated:

Just 5 countries emit over 65% of total CO₂.

Global efforts must prioritize these countries for change.



2. ⚡ The energy sector is the primary source, accounting for ~72% of emissions.

Shifting toward renewable energy can greatly reduce this.



3. 📉 Some countries show improvement in emissions year-over-year, signaling the positive effect of environmental policies.


4. 👥 Average CO₂ per capita is relatively low, indicating that the problem is more about industrial output than individual behavior in many regions.


5. 🗺️ The dashboard's filters allow users to explore emissions by country and emission level, which helps in targeted policy-making or research.
